**Rotten Tomatoes Client**

====================

This simple Android application provides a great working example of [AbLE](phil-brown.github.io/AbLE/),
the *Annotation-based Layout Engine* for Android.

This was originally a code challenge for a job application. I did not get the job (probably because I wanted
to telecommute), but then I was sitting here with this nice *peice of app*, and I thought I would share it.

As for a **LICENSE** - consider this **free to use** - but only for *Good* (no evil-doers here, please). Just note
that *AbLE* is under the Apache License - and the other libraries used may have other licenses as well.
